Simple, vanilla JavaScript to-do list application. (No backend)
A very simple to-do list app developed using: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Notice how short and clear everything is.

All Hail @CaloloCosta, who origninated this app.

## Backend extension

Now, what would you have to do to add a Spring Boot back end to this app?
